# Cloud Native Security Controls Catalog

## Overview

This catalog provides a structured framework for implementing security best practices in cloud-native environments.
It synthesizes the foundational principles of the [Cloud Native Security Whitepaper](../security-whitepaper) and the Software Supply Chain Best Practices Paper into discrete, actionable objectives.

> **Note**: While this catalog is historically called the "Cloud Native Security Controls Catalog," these security objectives are expressed using the term **guidelines**. Throughout this document, we use "guidelines" to refer to the individual security recommendations, while "catalog" refers to the overall collection.

Guidelines are organized into Families, each representing a specific security domain. These families help you navigate and understand the scope of security guidelines across different aspects of cloud native systems.

Each entry contains the following components:
- **ID**: A unique identifier for traceability and mapping.
- **Title**: A short, concise summary of the guideline.
- **Originating Document**: The source publication (e.g., Cloud Native Security Whitepaper v1.0, Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0).
- **Objective**: The high-level security goal or intent of the guideline.
- **Guideline Mappings**: Cross-references to frameworks (e.g., NIST SP800-53r5) to indicate compliance alignment.
- **Recommendations**: Practical, non-binding guidance for implementation.

<a id="securing-artefacts"></a>

## Securing Artefacts

Guidelines for securing artefacts, including build process attestation, signing frameworks, key rotation, OCI registry support, and encryption.



<a id="cnsc-141"></a>

### Build Process Attestation | `CNSC-141`

**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Every step in the build process is signed and attested for process integrity

**Guideline Mappings**

**`NIST-800-53`**

| Reference ID | Remarks |
|--------------|----------|
| SI-1 | Policy and Procedures |
| SI-7 | Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity |


**Recommendations**

- The signing of artefacts should be performed at each stage of its life cycle. The final artefact bundle should include these collective signatures and itself be signed to give integrity to the completed artefact and all its associated metadata.


---



<a id="cnsc-142"></a>

### Build Signature Verification | `CNSC-142`

**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Every step in the build process verifies previously generated signatures

**Guideline Mappings**

**`NIST-800-53`**

| Reference ID | Remarks |
|--------------|----------|
| SI-1 | Policy and Procedures |
| SI-7 | Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity |


**Recommendations**

- The integrity and provenance of images, deployment configuration, and application packages included in artefacts should all be validated using the signatures generated by each step in its build process to ensure compliance


---



<a id="cnsc-143"></a>

### Artifact Signing Framework | `CNSC-143`

**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

A framework is used to manage signing of artefacts

**Guideline Mappings**

**`NIST-800-53`**

| Reference ID | Remarks |
|--------------|----------|
| IA-5 | Authenticator Management |


**Recommendations**

- Consider TUF/notary to sign OCI images. Notary makes use of a “root-of-trust” model to delegate trust from a single root to the individual teams or developers who sign artefacts. It uses additional metadata to allow clients to verify the freshness of content in a repository and protect against common attacks on update systems. Clients can make use of public keys to verify the contents of the repository.

| Reference ID | Remarks |
|--------------|----------|
| AC-4(6) | Information Flow Enforcement, Metadata |

<a id="cnsc-145"></a>

### Certification Authorization | `CNSC-145`

**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Artefacts any given party is authorized to certify are limited

**Guideline Mappings**

**`NIST-800-53`**

| Reference ID | Remarks |
|--------------|----------|
| AC-6 | Least Privilege |


**Recommendations**

- Trust should not be granted universally or indefinitely. Artefacts or metadata that a given party is trusted to certify should be restricted using selective trust delegations. Trust must expire at predefined intervals, unless renewed as weel as a party must only be trusted to perform the tasks assigned to it to ensure compartmentatlization


---



<a id="cnsc-146"></a>

### Key Rotation and Revocation | `CNSC-146`

**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Rotation and revocation of private keys is supported

**Guideline Mappings**

**`NIST-800-53`**

| Reference ID | Remarks |
|--------------|----------|
| SC-12 | Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management |


**Recommendations**

- The system must be prepared for when, not if, its private keys are compromised. The ability to rotate and revoke private keys must be built into the distribution mechanism. Additionally, multiple keys must be used for different tasks or roles, and a threshold of keys must be required for important roles. Finally, minimal trust must be placed in high-risk keys like those that are stored online or used in automated roles.


---



<a id="cnsc-147"></a>

---



<a id="cnsc-148"></a>

### Artifact Encryption | `CNSC-148`

**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

| Reference ID | Remarks |
|--------------|----------|
| SC-28(1) | Protection of Information at Rest, Cryptographic Protection |
| SC-13 | Cryptographic Protection |
| SC-8 | Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity |
| IA-5 | Authenticator Management |
| SC-12 | Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management |


**Recommendations**

- Ensure contents of the artefact remain confidential in transit and at rest, until it is consumed. These artefacts can be encrypted so that they are accessible by authorized parties, such as the clusters, vulnerability scanners, etc. t is recommended organizations use key management and distribution systems with identity and attestation mechanisms (e.g. SPIFFE/SPIRE)

---



<a id="cnsc-166"></a>

### Pipeline Modification Control | `CNSC-166`

**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Additionally, protected branches can be used to disallow dangerous use of force pushes, preventing the overwrite of commit histories and potential obfuscation of code changes.

**Guideline Mappings**

**`NIST-800-53`**

| Reference ID | Remarks |
|--------------|----------|
| AC-2(1) | Prerequisites and criteria for group and role membership are defined. |


**Recommendations**

- It is recommended to implement a key rotation policy to ensure that compromised keys will cease to be usable after a certain period of time. When a private key is known to have been compromised, it should be revoked and replaced immediately to shut off access for any unauthorized user. Organizations may also consider using short lived certificates or keys, which reduces the reliance on certificate revocation systems.

**Recommendations**

- Short-life credential issuance encourages the use of fine grained permissions and automation in provisioning access tokens. For CI/CD pipeline agents, short-lived access tokens should be considered instead of password-based credentials. The use of very short-lived tokens like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, etc., will help to implement more secure access and increase the security assurance.
